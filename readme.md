# Fluid Systems Demo
Web Designer Magazine for March 2015 featured a little tutorial I wrote on a Mobile-First Approach to Fluid Typography and Layouts. Essentially, the concept enables you to proportionally control you site's layout and typography from a single font-size declaration on the body tag.

This is a demo of that.

## A CodeKit Project 
This project s set up in CodeKit. The -kit folder acts as a working folder for the assets, which output to the folders of the same name (usually, for minification and such). So, kit/assets/scss/ap.scss outputs to assets/css/app.css

## SCSS
For the sake of this demo, all scss are not arranged in subfolders, but are still broken up across files. 

'_config.scss' houses variables. 

JS included is just for Google fonts.
